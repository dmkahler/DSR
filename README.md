# Diffusion-Sorption-Reaction Model  

## Purpose  
The purpose of this model was to simulate the diffusion of silver from the MadiDrop.  It used a rudementary Euler method to solve the Lagrangian (please don't laugh).  Next iterations will upgrade the solver, which runs very slowly.

Parameterization was made possible thanks to the contributions of E. Chen and L. Waite of the University of Virginia for the experimental bucket diffusion analysis and F. A. DaCosta of the Department of Mining and Environmental Geology at the University of Venda for the mineral analysis of the Mukondeni clay samples.  T. S. Singh of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Virginia provided invaluable support on all instrumentation, especially the mercury porosimeter and atomic absorption spectrometer.  The model was compiled with a Fortran compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and is made possible by the GCC team and the Free Software Foundation (www.gnu.com).  The code is stored via Mendeley Data, Mendeley Ltd.  Computing support was provided by the Advanced Research Computing Services at the University of Virginia; the authors especially thank J. Huband and K. Holcomb.
